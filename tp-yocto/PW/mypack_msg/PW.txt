Recipe with local header file
=============================

In this exercise we use a more complex example that includes a header file (.h). The source code is given below. The MSG constant is defined in "message.h"

#include <stdio.h>

#include "message.h"
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
   printf("%s\n", MSG);

   return 0;
}

Work to be done:

1- Using course material, complete the provided .bb skeleton (replace the '???') and build a correct directory for the recipe in 'meta-training/recipes-core'

-> we will use a 'files' directory containing the 'message.h' file with the following line:

#define MSG "my message"



2- Install and test the produced package
