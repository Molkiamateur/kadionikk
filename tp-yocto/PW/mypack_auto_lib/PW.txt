Using a library (dependencies)
==============================

The purpose of this exercise is to use the previously created library recipe.

The source code of the example is close to that of the first 'Hello World' except that it refers 
to the function provided by the 'libbbexample.so.1' library.

main (int ac, char **av)
{
   ...

   LibHelloWorld();
}

Work to be done:

1- Add a correct 'mypack-auto-lib' directory for the recipe whose .bb file is provided

2- Test the production of the package

3- Install the new package on target -> test the installation dependency with the library
