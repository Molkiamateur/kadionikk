Creating a new "distro"
=======================

The goal of the lab is to create a new "distro" called "ecs" and based on "poky".

1- Add the distro definition in meta-training/conf/distro/<???>.conf

The new distro is based on 'poky':

require conf/distro/poky.conf      
DISTRO = "???"
DISTRO_NAME = "???"
DISTRO_VERSION = "1.0"

2- Update conf/local.conf to use the new distro

DISTRO = "???"

3- Build training-image for the new distro and test it

$ bitbake training-image

$ runqemu training-image

-> explain the result !
