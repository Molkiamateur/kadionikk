Creating 'Hello World' recipes
==============================

The goal of the exercise is to create simple recipes (like "Hello World") using:

- A standard Makefile
- Autotools
- CMake (source from a tar+gz archive then from a Git repository)

Work to be done:

1- Create the directories for the 4 recipes in meta-training/recipes-core

2- Using the course support, finalize the provided .bb skeletons (replace the '???') then add them to the meta-training layer

-> Calculate the MD5 checksum with the 'md5sum' command, then add the value to the recipe . The tar.gz archives are in qemuarm-build/downloads.

No checksum is necessary for the Git based recipe !

$ md5sum downloads/<archive>

3- Build, install and test the packages (using OPKG)

On the PC:

$ bitbake <list-of-recipes>
$ bitbake package-index

On the board:

# opkg update
# opkg install <list-of-packages>
