Creating a special image (with package group)
=============================================

The goal is to create the same image by using a 'package group' that will be installed in the meta-training/recipes-core/packagegroups directory.

The image recipe will be installed in meta-training/recipes-core/images.

We will use the same packages:

- mypack-gen
- mypack-auto
- mypack-auto-lib
- hello-mod

We can build then test the image with the following commands:

$ bitbake training-image-pg

Now we can stop the QEMU emulator with 'Ctrl-A X' then start the new image:

$ runqemu training-image-pg nographic
