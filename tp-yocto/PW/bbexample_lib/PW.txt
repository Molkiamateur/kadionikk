Shared library recipe (.so)
===========================

The goal of this lab is to create a recipe for a dynamic library.
This library will be used in another recipe (next exercise) and provides the LibHelloWorld() function which simply displays a message.

Work to be done:

1- Add a correct 'bbexample-lib' directory for the recipe after completing the provided .bb file

2- Test the recipe production

-> display the content of the produced .ipk (including the -dev file) with 'dpkg -c'
-> please note the name of the produced package (libbbexample*.ipk)

PLEASE DO *NOT* INSTALL THE PACKAGE !

We will test the installation on target in the next PW.
