Extending a recipe with .bbappend
=================================

The purpose of this exercise is to modify the mypack-msg package (previous exercise) by updating the
displayed message (MSG constant in "message.h"), i.e. using a .bbappend in ANOTHER LAYER (meta-training2). 

Work to be done:

1- Copy the "mypack-msg" directory provided with the exercise to the 'meta-training2/recipes-core' directory

2- Replace the '???' in the recipe + files/ directory

3- Check the presence of .bbappend with the following command

$ bitbake-layers show-appends | grep mypack

4- Build the new package

$ bitbake mypack-msg

5- Upgrade the 'mypack-msg' package on the target and check the result

# opkg update
# opkg upgrade
