Using ptest
===========

The goal of the exercise is to a build a very simple recipe including 'ptest' functionality and running on training-image.

The recipe is based on the - famous - 'fahr' program (Celsius to Farenheit conversion) :-)

We provide a data set (in files/ directory) in order to test the program with
'ptest-runner'

1- Replace the '???' in the provided recipe and add it to meta-training/recipes-core/fahr

2- Add the following lines to conf/local.conf 

IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " fahr"
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "ptest-pkgs"

3- Build the new image

$ bitbake training-image

4- Test the new image on the board and try the unit testing script for 'fahr'

$ runqemu training-image nographic

# ptest-runner -l
# ptest-runner fahr
