What is schedutils?
--------------------

Schedutils is a collection of tools related to realtime scheduling,
working much like 'nice' and 'renice', except they change the priority
and scheduler.This enables a process to run in soft realtime, as
specified by POSIX1.1b.
the tools are
        getsched - prints out current scheduler/priority for a process/PID
        resched  - changes the scheduler/priority for a process/PID
        sched    - executes a program with another scheduler/priority.

How do I install schedutils?
----------------------------
Run the configure script with the appropriate parameters, run
./configure --help to see what's available.
then run make to compile the programs, and run make install
to install it(as root).

* note for Solaris users: if autoconf doesnt figure out that libposix4
is needed, so before running configure, the LDFLAGS need to be set to
posix4, e.g 'LDFLAGS=posix4 ./configure'

There's also a make uninstall to uninstall the programs.
