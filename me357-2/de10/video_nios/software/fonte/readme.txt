Readme - Hello MicroC/OS-II Hello Software Example

Hello_uosii is a simple hello world program running MicroC/OS-II.  The
purpose of the design is to be a very simple application that just
demonstrates MicroC/OS-II running on NIOS II.  The design doesn't account
for issues such as checking system call return codes. etc.
The uC/OS-II is a portable, ROMable, scalable, preemptive, 
real-time deterministic multitasking kernel for microprocessors, 
microcontrollers and DSPs. Offering unprecedented ease-of-use, uC/OS-II 
is delivered with complete 100% ANSI C source code and in-depth documentation.
uC/OS-II runs on the largest number of processor architectures, 
with ports available for download from the Micrium Web site.
