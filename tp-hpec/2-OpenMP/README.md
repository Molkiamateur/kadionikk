# SE301-High-Performance-Computing

## OpenMP experiments

This directory contains a set of simple examples that use OpenMP to parallelize multi-core implementations of simple algorithms.

The first two directories contain pedagogical examples prepared for you by your teacher. Discuss the way to parralelize them, run them and discuss the performance level obtained. The next two directories contain examples that you have to complete yourself and analyze.

The last directory is there to let you try and implement multiprocessing
yourself using threads (and see how painful it is)

Have a good time.
